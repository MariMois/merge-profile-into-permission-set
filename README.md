# Merge Profile Into Permission Set

A Python utility to merge Salesforce **Profile** metadata into a **Permission Set** XML, producing a deployable Permission Set.

## âœ¨ Features
âœ… Merges all compatible permissions from a Profile into a Permission Set  
âœ… Deduplicates entries  
âœ… Cleans namespaces for a valid deployable file  
âœ… **NEW:** When a permission exists in both, the script merges them and picks the **less restrictive** option (e.g. `editable=true` if either side has it)  
âœ… Logs what was added, updated, or skipped
